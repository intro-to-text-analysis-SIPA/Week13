# Week 13: Text analysis: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
For our final course content week, we will learn about term frequency-inverse document frequency, often abbreviated TF-IDF. TF-IDF is a text analysis method that builds off word frequency but it more specifically tries to identify the most distinctively frequent and significant words.

- Topics covered: 
    - What is TF-IDF?
    - What are practical applications of TF-IDF?
    - How to perform TF-IDF on a collection of speeches?
    - How to use this method with other text data sources?
- Curriculum for this session:
    - Melanie Walsh, _Introduction to Cultural Analytics_, [TF-IDF Intro](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/05-Text-Analysis/01-TF-IDF.html) & [TF-IDF with Scikit-Learn](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/05-Text-Analysis/03-TF-IDF-Scikit-Learn.html)
- Assignments due before class:
   - Work through the curriculum for the upcoming week's session in a Jupyter Notebook. Download your Jupyter Notebook as "ipynb" file (Go to "File", "Download as", "Notebook (.ipynb)"), and [upload](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) the file to the weekly GitHub assignment link.
        -  You are welcome to use the dataset provided in the curriculum link or use a dataset of your choice.
